- I will cover both sending and receiving data in the master mode.
 Also I am going to use the ADXL345 for the demonstration

> SPI communication uses 4 Pins 

1. MOSI Master Out Slave In is used to send the data to the Slave
2. MISO Master in Slave out is used to receive the data from the slave
3. SCK Serial Clock is used to keep the master and slave in sync
4. SS Slave select is used to select and unselect the slave
